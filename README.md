# deno-another-cookiejar

This is just a very simple cookiejar for using with deno's fetch.

Why the name ? because I didn't want to reserve the cookiejar name, since this library may not be good at it.

## usage

## notes

This library does not strictly follow the specs, but does try to follow it loosely. just keep it in mind when using so you don't get surprises.

does not support handling of `__Secure-` and `__Host-` cookies.
